<p>From a young age, I've been captivated by the human experience of perceiving the world around us, how we shape our
    realities, and the narratives we construct. Currently, I'm pursuing my studies in IMT, Image and Media Technology at
    HKU; University of
    the Arts Utrecht. In my own visuals, I strive to show the extraordinary within the seemingly ordinary and to
    liberate reality from the invented frameworks we impose on it. I draw inspiration from my immediate surroundings,
    such as nature and the urban
    landscape, the often beautiful erosion of lifeless objects, and life beyond the everyday theater of humanity. I
    currently utilize various media such as photography, graphic design, and videography.</p>
